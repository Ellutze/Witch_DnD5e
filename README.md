This is an open source class compatible with DnD5e with 3 sub-classes. Github was selected with hopes of collaboration on future versions.


This is currently under development - content is being migrated from private documents - bare with me!

The documentation is technically the content here : https://ellutze.github.io/Witch_DnD5e/
