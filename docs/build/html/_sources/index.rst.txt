This is the Witch class compatible with DnD 5e - ENJOY!
=======================================================

Introduction
============

This page outlines the Witch class, compatible with DnD 5E. This is a class I originally made for my own homebrew, but with limited time it gets limited amount of play. Hence, I decided to make this class public, with the hopes that others will choose to roleplay as a Witch.

Witch is a full caster, but the core difference is in the roleplay, which is reflected in her abilities. The Witch does not seek power, she understands that magic is not to be taken lightly, and will only use it when absolutely needed. However, others recognizing her as a Witch 
will often make it unnecessary for the Witch to cast spells. Making others think she has cast a spell, is often as effective as casting it. 

I felt like this kind of caster is missing in the core DnD, with Sorcerers, Wizards and Warlocks not lending themselves very well to this magic philosophy. More details in the :doc:`Core Witch` page.

This repository is for DMs and players alike. It should at the very least allow you to understand Witch's abilities, help you select a subclass and walk you through the Witch leveling process.

I am hoping to be adding more specific examples with character sheets, Witch specific quests, and land tips for the :doc:`One with the Land` subclass. However, that will be added as the Witch sees more play. Even while I tried, I do not know how well balanced the Witch is, so feel free to tweak.

The reason this is built as a Git repository (besides ease of use) is to enable collaboration. Feel free to make clones, branches and pull requests to add things - ideally examples of play (more specific instructions of how to contribute are still a TODO). Any feedback is much appreciated.

Notable inspirations
====================

The Witch desribed here draws upon variety of inspirations and it would be impossible to acknowledge all. 

However, I specifically use the term :ref:`borrowing` and :ref:`headology`, terms from Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels. These are not mechanically unique, but I found these terms most appropriate and I sincerely hope I don't annoy any Terry Pratchett's fans (or IP holders) by borrowing (intended) these terms.
"Borrowing" is essentially "skinchanging" or "warging" from Songs of Ice and Fire, [insert obvious example my brain forgot here], or even "shintenshin no jutsu" from Naruto. Equally "headology" is a typical trope where abilities appear supernatural, but are simply evidence of intelligence, wisdom, wit and sometimes charisma (Think Mentalist, Loki, Dr. House, Sherlock Holmes, L).
