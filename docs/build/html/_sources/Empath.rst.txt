Empath
======

Empath it the Witch that truly understands people. This makes her naturally focused on helping whoever she can. However, it also allows her to get in people's head (sometimes literally), which is yet another reason not to make this Witch your enemy.

Charisma is Empath's spellcasting ability.

Empath gains proficiency at Charisma and Wisdom saving throws.

The key ability of Empath is to temporarily learn any spell that she observes being cast, by anyone, friend or foe. This is ability only works on humanoids, and most demons and devils (at discretion of DM). This ability is used as a reaction when target casts a spell, the learning takes place after the effect of the spell, and hence is prevented by spells that will make the Witch indisposed. Witch must have an appropriate spell slot level available (can't learn higher spells for later, but can learn when out of spell-slots temporarily). Only 1 spell can be maintained through long rest initially, increasing to two spells at level 6, and to three spells at level 11. Yes, this introduces cost to long-resting.

Empath can use the :ref:`borrowing` on humanoids as well as animals. Target will likely dislike this - target can succeed intelligence saving throw against it, DC = 6 +witch intelligence modifier +witch charisma modifier.

Empaths :ref:`your_pain_my_pain` ability is not limited to once per short rest, at level 5 she can do this indefinitely.

On level 7 Empath gets additional proficiencies in charisma based skills of her choice.

At level 8 Empath gets to cast a headology spell for free once per short rest. This increases to 2 at level 15, and 3 at level 19.

The capstones differ only to some extent between subclasses,  refer to :doc:`Leveling` at level 20 for details.
