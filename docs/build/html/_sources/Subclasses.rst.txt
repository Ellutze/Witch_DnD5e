**Hag (HG)**

Hag is not yet developed, it is a potential idea for future development, that would mainly be used for NPC design. This would be a subclass any of the other 3 can chose to switch to, if the Witch abandonds her principles and abuses her powers whenever it suits her (akin to Oathbraker).

The OWL Hag would turn the land into hostile place for any visitors, would corrupt all that is tied to it. Empath would abuse her understanding of human mind to take control of people, turning them into thralls at her will. Bookworm Hag would collect the most vile spells known in search of power, giving up on the idea of limited magic usage. 

For players this would only be available at higher levels (or the specific powers would be available at higher levels).
