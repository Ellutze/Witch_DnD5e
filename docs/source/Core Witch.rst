Core Witch
==========

This section first describes the unique mechanics of Witch, interwoven with information that helps with roleplay. 

The Witch gets these abilities at different levels, this should be covered by :doc:`Leveling` guide.

At the moment I would recommend Dungeon Masters to forbid Witch multiclassing unless they have a flexible agreement with players on balancing during campaign. Very little though was given to multiclasssing to date. (If you do try, I would love to hear about it thought!)

Witch is a "she" by strong convention. If player and DM want a male Which, sure , but it should than be a strong part of the PCs identity.

Each Witch has a senior Witch that taught her the basics of what being a Witch is all about. It is crucial that player has a good idea about who this mentor is, as it has likely shaped the Witch herself.

Roleplay suggestions
--------------------

Witch does not seek straight up fights, she aims to outwit the enemy into defeating themselves. This should be reinforced by the highly utilitarian nature of Witches abilities.

Witch on the default cares, cares deeply about people, about the land, and mainly about what "is right".

Many young Witches think Witchcraft is about spells and curses, but really it's about people, knowing how to help, knowing how to do ordinary things (midwifery, gardening, easing the pains...), and being there when others have failed.

Starting equipment
-------------------

	- Pointy hat. This is part of witch's identity. While wearing a pointy hat Witch has :underline:`+1 to spell casting ability score`. For this to be active Witch must be wearing any pointy-hat, not a specific one, but it must be clearly visible. Witch simply becomes more of a witch when it is clear to everyone she is one. This is about perception, which means that disguise that removes the pointy-hat will remove this buff.
	- Travel cauldron
	- Travel kettle, and bunch of herbs for tea (player selection)
	- 4 small health potions
	- Healer's kit

.. _headology:

Headology
---------

Witches have magical talent and can cast spells, the same way Sorcerers do. However, Witch understands that tinkering with magic should not be done lightly, and prefers tricking others into thinking she is casting magic. This is called "headology", and applies for spells that could take effect simply due to psychology, without the need for magic. 

These spells are marked (H) in the :doc:`Spells List`. 
When Witches cast headology it takes significantly less magical effort than conventional magic. It takes one spell-slot for a Witch to cast "headology" spell, while it takes 3 spell slots to cast conventional spells (1 of the appropriate level, supplemented by 2 of any level). For balance this is accommodated for by Witches having comparably more spell slots than other classes. In practice Witch should be able to cast
way more if she uses headology most of the time, and way less if she uses other spells (compared to Wizards and Sorcerers). "Headology" cantrips cost nothing, while non-headology cantrips cost 1 lvl-1 spell slot.

The degree to which Witch wants to restrain herself from casting "real" magic (a.k.a. not headology) is up to a player. However, on default Witches should be reserved in that regard, which also helps mechanically. (Metagaming and roleplaying should meet nicely here)

.. _borrowing:

Borrowing 
---------

Witch can invade consciousness of another being (usually animal), seeing through their eyes and commanding their actions. It is traditional that Witch thanks the target later for their service (i.e. by providing food). 

The Witch herself is essentially unconscious while this is happening, her body going limp as if she was in very deep sleep.

To command a beast or animal to do something that would be against their nature will require deception/persuasion checks resisted by target intelligence saving throw.

(TODO: make list of intelligences for beasts and animals, for now at DMs discretion)

To initiate this, Witch must be aware of the animal's presence within 300ft.

The Range of how far the animal can travel under this effect is 3km.

This takes bonus action to initiate. It takes action and bonus action of the animal to return back.

For roleplaying purposes Witch is aware that this may be dangerous. The longer the Witch borrows the mind of the animal, the more she becomes that animal. Witches have been known to have their mind lost to the animal while borrowing, never returning to their body.
This lends itself nicely to some roleplay where the Witch keeps some gimmicks from the animal for short time after borrowing.

.. _your_pain_my_pain:

Your pain my pain
-----------------

All Witches gain "your pain, my pain".

- Once per short rest a Witch can take damage that would otherwise be dealt to someone else within 10ft of her (this cannot be used if it would down the Witch). The Witch decides to do this after the damage has been rolled. This is a reaction.
- (EMP) is not limited to once per short rest, can do this indefinitely
- (OWL) takes only half the damage immediately, other half at the end of combat (when she considers to be safe, this delayed damage is none-lethal)
- (BW) can also do the reverse to a willing player/creature (her damage received by another)
- This can be done to heal people out of combat.
- The out of combat healing trades (lvl/2)*d6 damage (round to nearest integer mathematically)


Proficiencies
-------------

Witches will not wear armour on principle, this is beneath her (with exception of BW, see details in :doc:`Bookworm`).

Proficient with spell-casting focuses.

Witches are not technically proficient with any weapons, but in their hands anything can be temporarily used as a weapon. 
Improvised weapon attack with a “surprise” weapon (witch just picked up) will have advantage on hit for this and next turn.
Player is expected to provide a plausible way to use the “weapon” to hurt somebody. Any improvised weapon will do 1d4+1 dmg (as opposed to 1d4) and can be imbued by other effects very easily 
(Bone of recently deceased zombie will do +proficiency score in necrotic damage, hot poker will do +proficiency score in fire damage…. At DMs discretion). This is intended for low stakes combat and mainly for roleplaying purposes,
but can also be a decent supplemental damage at early levels.
 
Medicine, can be picked again below to enhance the effect.

Choose 3 skills to be proficient with from :  Investigation, Nature, Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, perception, survival (more will come from subclass at higher level)

Saving throw proficiencies per subclass: 
- EMP gains proficiency at Charisma and Wisdom saving throws.
- OWL and BW gain proficiency at Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws.

Witch is an independent entity and proud of her skills - she cannot get “help” when undertaking any skill based activities that she is proficient in (This should be balanced by extra ability scores).

Ability Scores
--------------

Witch is not characterised by being specifically wise, or intelligent or charismatic. What makes a Witch a Witch, is being able to utilize to great potential the innate abilities she possess. Empathetic Witch will rely on her charisma (EMP). Witch that has learned from books will rely on intellect (BW). Witch that learns by careful observation of the world and the situation around her will rely on her wisdom (OWL).

Ability spell-casting modifier is based on subclass. EMP = charisma. OWL = wisdom. BW = bookworm.

Spell Slots
-----------
Witch learns 3 cantrips immediately, and 1 more cantrip at lvl 5. She stays at 4 for the rest of the campaign, but can replace cantrip at levels 10 and 15 (be flexible DMs! :P)

As mentioned, the goal is for a Witch to be able to cast more than any other class if using headology spells, but less than Wizard and Sorcerer if using non-headology spells. 

The logic currently adopted is as follows: 

1. Take table for Wizard.
2. All spell slots are multiplied by 1.5.
3. All that started with 1 get rounded down (1s stay 1s), and the highest level currently available is rounded down.
4. All others are rounded up. 

You don't have to do the math yourself, here is a table:

.. image:: Spell_slot_table.*
    :width: 400

Note, the balance has only been tested at low level of play. Please give feedback, this will inevitably be adjusted in future for balance.

Known Spells
------------
Again, subject to balance.

For now:

- LvL1 : 2
- LvL2 : 3
- Lvl3 : 4 

From then on, learning 1 every 2 levels. BW learns extra 1 spell every 2 levels from scroll. This does not require any gold. However, Bookworm has to use another scroll to replace 1 of these slot, all spells are prepared.


Notes for gameplay
------------------

Early game heavy use of headology can do a lot, later in the game which will have to rely on her sub-class to be useful in combat - overall Witch should be a high utility, low damage character.
