Hag (HG)
--------

Not developed, potentially in future, not sure if needed. This would be a subclass any of the other 3 can chose to switch to, if the Witch abandonds her principles and abuses her powers whenever it suits her (akin to Oathbraker).

This would mostly be useful to build NPC within the Witch framework.
