One with the Land
=================

One with the land (OWL) is the kind of Witch you find in secluded cottage. The kind of Witch people fear, yet they come to her for help. On default she is friendly with the local villages, she takes care of them as any other Witch would. However, she cares more for the land itself as she believes that it is in the interest of all that the land is healthy. She cares for the land: the trees, the animals, the insects, the fertile soil, the temperamental weather. 

OWL gain proficiency at Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws.

OWL may be provided additional spells from the land she is currently on, if the land supports her actions. At lower levels the Witch has to be guessing what the land wants, but from level 6 OWL learns to listen to the land: The Witch can find a prominent place in the local land/biome and meditate listening to the ailments and affinities of the land, even receiving explicit quests.

Typically land will be approving of certain actions and species and dislike others. There might be something ailing the land that it wants resolved, e.g. lumber jacks cutting key part of the local forest.

The OWL depends heavily on the DM, so do have a conversation with the DM about playing this. The DM needs to understand what does the land itself want, in each location the Witch finds herself in. There are some spells below that can be given for certain domains, but some homebrew will always be required here. In rare circumstances the land may stand against the Witch, but there should always be course of action that will make the land adopt the Witch.

OWL gets perks if staying in land she considers her home (e.g. at DM discretions some spell require only one spell slot, as it is cast with the magic borrowed from the land)

If OWL has a good knowledge of an animal specie, she can speak freely with it without requiring "speak with animals". Player can specify 1 specie like this at the start of the campaign.

OWL recovers 1 spell slot per short rest when resting in land that supports her.

OWL is the Witch subclass that is most accustomed to :ref:`Borrowing` in it's natural form (i.e. controlling animals). OWL gets increased range to everywhere in the same “land”, if the land is supporting Witch’s actions she can pick up animals consciousness at any range.

OWL's special perk for :ref:`your_pain_my_pain` is that she takes only half the damage immediately, other half at the end of combat (when she considers to be safe, this delayed damage is none-lethal - meaning the lowest it can bring the Witch is 1hp).

From level 7 onwards, OWL gets +2 constitution and proficiency in constitution saving throws when she is staying the same land for more than 2 days (regardless of affinity with the land).

On level 7 OWL also gets proficiency in 2 of the wisdoms based skills (can improve her existent proficiency).

The capstones differ only to some extent between subclasses, refer to :doc:`Leveling` at level 20 for details.

An OWL NPC lends itself to some great legendary actions! (TODO)
