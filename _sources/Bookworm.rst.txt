Bookworm
========

Bookworm learned her magic mostly from books, not unlike Wizards. She has natural talents of a Witch, and she likes to use magic to help people in their daily lives, but just like a Wizard she likes to seek this knowledge in books. Bookworm, unlike a Wizard, is likely 
to read all sorts of books, not just magic. She will know many stories from far away land, she is likely to know the history of a random town, etc... The specific reading interests are to be discussed with DM (advantage on history/intelligence check on those topics is suggested, but at DMs discretion).

Bookworm will read any book or text presented to her in super-human speed, book that would take others hour to study, bookworm can digest during short rest.

Bookworm has affinity towards magical books and scrolls, and will be able to sense any such items within 60ft with a little bit of focus (1 action).

Bookworm understands the value of good light armour and can obscure it, being seemingly true to "Witches ain't needin no armor" while actually being smart about it. She will not like to admit she is wearing it, but is proficient at light armour.

Can learn spells similarly to Wizard (from scroll). However, BW can only memorize 1 spell this way per 2 levels starting at level 1. Witch has all her spells prepared, to replace any of those spells she can use scroll again, but if spell limit is reached she will overwrite one of the existent spells.

Bookworm spellcasting ability is intelligence.

Gains proficiency at Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws.

At levels 5 and 17 Bookworm learns about a type of entity (select from: elemental, fey, fiend, giant, ooze, dragon, construct, aberration). Basic 
members of this group (non-boses, non-unique monsters) will be subject to BWs borrowing ability (similar to EMP for humanoids):  target will likely dislike this - target can succeed intelligence saving throw against it, DC = 6+witch intelligence modifier+witch charisma modifier ). The 
Witch also gets a very good understanding about that type of creature (resistances, hit-points, habitats, vulnerabilities, ACs... ).

Bookworm can use the :ref:`your_pain_my_pain` ability in reverse, allowing willing PC/NPC/creature to take the damage that would otherwise be received by Bookworm.

On level 7 Bookworm gets ability to turn headology spell into non-headology if the target successfully saved it, effectively making the target re-roll for the cost of additional 2 spell slots (any level).

The capstones differ only to some extent between subclasses, refer to :doc:`Leveling` at level 20 for details.

For roleplay purposes author suggest DM provides a magical book that Bookworm carries with her. This book does not on it's own contain any knowledge, but Bookworm can (as free-cast ability) make the book seem like any other book she has seen, and create any fake or real content she is desires.
